## This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to commands that are useful for working and collaborating in a Git repository (repo).

## Initializing
Starting up Git within a project and getting it connected.
```
git init
Initializes (or starts) your current working directory
(folder) as a Git repository (repo).

git clone https://www.github.com/username/repo-name
Copies an existing Git repo hosted remotely.

git remote or git remote -v
Shows your current Git directory’s remote repo. Use the
-v flag for more info.

git remote add upstream https://www.github.com/username/repo-name
Adds the Git upstream to a URL. Post this, all the git push
commands will push the changes to this URL by default.
```

# Staging
Creating files staged after modifying a file and
marking it ready to go in the next commit.
```
git status
Checks the status of your Git repo, including files added
that are not staged.

git add. or git add my_script.js
Stages modified files. If you make changes that you want included in
the next commit, you can run add again. Use “git add .” for all files
to be staged, or specify specific files by name.

git reset my_script.js
Removes a file from staging while retaining changes within your working directory.
```
# Committing
Recording changes made to the repository.
```
git commit -m "Commit message"
Commits staged files with a meaningful commit message so that you and
others can track commits.

git commit -am "Commit message"
Condenses all tracked files by committing them in one step.

git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
Modifies your commit message.
```
# Branching
Isolating work and managing feature development in one
place.
```
git branch
Lists all current branches. An asterisk (*) will appear
next to your currently active branch.

git branch new-branch
Creates a new branch. You will remain on your currently
active branch until you switch to the new one.

git checkout another-branch
Switches to any existing branch and checks it out into
your current working directory.

git checkout -b new-branch
Consolidates the creation and checkout of a new branch.

git branch -d branch-name
Deletes a branch.
```

# Collaborating and Sharing
Downloading changes from another repository or sharing
changes with the larger codebase.
```
git push origin main
Pushes or sends your local branch commits to the remote repo. 
Note: some repos use master instead of main in their commands.

git pull
Fetches and merges any commits from the tracking remote branch.

git merge upstream/main
Merges the fetched commits.
```
# Showing Changes
See changes between commits, branches, and more.
```
git diff --staged
Compares modified files that are in the staging area.

git diff a-branch..b-branch
Displays the diff of what is in `a-branch` but is not in `b-branch`.

git diff 61 ce 3 e6..e221d9c
Uses commit id to show the diff between two specific
commits.
```
